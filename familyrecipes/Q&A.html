            <ul class="titlequestions">
                <li>Is it hard to post a recipe?</li>
                <li class="answerquestions"> Not at all! All you do is click a button and enter in the recipe!</li>
                <li>Why come visit my site?</li>
                <li class="answerquestions">Families will come to my site because it is filled with
                    childhood recipes that can bring
                    you comfort when you are feeling down. I know when I am having a rough day at college and want a
                    piece
                    of home I
                    go and recreate a recipe from my childhood. Then just for that moment, I am back at home and in the
                    comfort of my
                    family. Life can be difficult sometimes and to have a taste of home where you can feel love is all
                    that
                    matters.
                <li>What will you get when you visit my site?</li>
                <li class="answerquestions">Visitors will come to my site instead of someone
                    else’s
                    because
                    they can have the ability to create their own. It will be set up similar to an Instagram page where
                    you
                    can add,
                    follow, like, and save all your favorite recipes and you can have that be a connection to your
                    family.
                    You can
                    customize it any way you want. Super simple and easy.</li>
                <li>Questions answered</li>
                <li class="answerquestions">This site answers the question of when you don’t know what to bake you can
                    find
                    the
                    recipes
                    from your old favorites. Or when your family back home isn’t picking up you can have the recipes
                    right
                    there with
                    all the correct measurements and all the correct ingredients. No more guessing because no one at
                    home
                    will pick
                    up. So it answers the question of what to eat and how to make it.</li>
