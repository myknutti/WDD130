    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Isn’t it hard when you are trying to cook something to feel a piece of home and you can’t remember that
      ingredient that will finish off your grandma’s famous cookies? My idea for a website is to incorporate my favorite
      recipes for all the grandkids of my family to have our best-loved recipes when we live all over. I want the
      website to be available for my family to scroll through and see the many different recipes and have instructions
      on how to do each one, even having a place where they can add more. My unique selling proposition is that I would
      do a website wire to do for other families so then every family can have this fun recipe page of their families'
      unique recipes. </p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My intended audience is families of all sorts that love to cook. When we are away at college or newlyweds and we
      want a taste of our childhood most times you try to call your mom but sometimes that doesn’t work out. So having a
      website where we can all post our favorite recipes from childhood will help everyone stay connected. You don’t
      have to be a big family or a small family we love all shapes and sizes of the family to come together through
      cooking. </p> <!-- change this -->

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      Isn't it hard when you are trying to cook something to feel a piece of home and you can’t remember that ingredient
      that will finish off your grandma's famous cookies? My idea for a website is to incorporate my favorite recipes
      for all the grandkids of my family to have our best-loved recipes when we live all over. I want the website to be
      available for my family to scroll through and see the many different recipes and have instructions on how to do
      each one, even having a place where they can add more. My unique selling proposition is that I would do a website
      wire to do for other families so then every family can have this fun recipe page of their families' unique
      recipes.

    </ul>
    <h3>What to do</h3>
    <p>
      Activities to be completed The activity that visitors will come to my website to accomplish is making food and who
      doesn’t like food. Along with just making food, it is making your childhood favorite foods. When you come to my
      website everything will be uploaded already so all you have to do is go to the grocery store and come home to
      bake. You can also look at other people’s recipes if you have time and want to try something new and interesting.
      What information do you need to bring to the table? The only information necessary to complete any action for the
      website is to have the recipe to be able to add to the website with all the measurements and ingredients. Like I
      was saying in come visit my site the page will be set up like an Instagram page. Where you can add all your
      favorite recipes or Grandma can put in her famous sugar cookies and you can have access to them all the time. You
      can follow family members and you can try other families' recipes if they allow (we all know Grandma won’t share
      her recipes with everyone). Once you add the initial information you can look online anytime.

    </ul>
    <h3>Q & A</h3>
    <p>
      Why come visit my site? Families will come to my site because it is filled with childhood recipes that can bring
      you comfort when you are feeling down. I know when I am having a rough day at college and want a piece of home I
      go and recreate a recipe from my childhood. Then just for that moment, I am back at home and in the comfort of my
      family. Life can be difficult sometimes and to have a taste of home where you can feel love is all that matters.
      That is what you can get when you visit my site. Visitors will come to my site instead of someone else’s because
      they can have the ability to create their own. It will be set up similar to an Instagram page where you can add,
      follow, like, and save all your favorite recipes and you can have that be a connection to your family. You can
      customize it any way you want. Super simple or if you want to go overboard there will be stuff you can do for that
      as well.
      Questions answered This site answers the question of when you don’t know what to bake you can find the recipes
      from your old favorites. Or when your family back home isn’t picking up you can have the recipes right there with
      all the correct measurements and all the correct ingredients. No more guessing because no one at home will pick
      up. So it answers the question of what to eat and how to make it.
