            <p class="contentwhattodo">Activities to be completed The activity that visitors will come to my website to
                accomplish is making food and who
                doesn’t like food. Along with just making food, it is making your childhood favorite foods. When you
                come to my
                website everything will be uploaded already so all you have to do is go to the grocery store and come
                home to
                bake. You can also look at other people’s recipes if you have time and want to try something new and
                interesting.
                What information do you need to bring to the table? The only information necessary to complete any
                action for the
                website is to have the recipe to be able to add to the website with all the measurements and
                ingredients. Like I
                was saying in come visit my site the page will be set up like an Instagram page. Where you can add all
                your
                favorite recipes or Grandma can put in her famous sugar cookies and you can have access to them all the
                time. You
                can follow family members and you can try other families' recipes if they allow (we all know Grandma
                won’t share
                her recipes with everyone). Once you add the initial information you can look online anytime.</p>
